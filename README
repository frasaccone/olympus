Set the `ARCH` environment variable to the desired target architecture. If it
is not set, the packages will be built for the host architecture.

To compile the core packages, the following dependencies are required:

- POSIX shell.
- Basic POSIX utilities.
- Cross [GNU C toolchain](https://gcc.gnu.org/) for `ARCH`.
- [GNU M4](https://www.gnu.org/software/m4/). By default, packages use the `m4`
  command; the `M4` environment variable may be set to the desired program.
- [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/). By default, packages use the
  `gmake` command; the `GMAKE` environment variable may be set to the desired
  program.
- [Gzip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip) decompressor. By default, packages
  use the `gz` command; the `GZ` environment variable may be set to the desired
  program.
- [Lex](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lex.1p.html). By default,
  packages use the `lex` command; the `LEX` environment variable may be set to
  the desired program.

To build the core packages to PREFIX, use the following command inside this
directory:

	pr -s . -p PREFIX -i $(ls core)
