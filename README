Package repository for [`pr`](git://francescosaccone.com/pr).

Preparation
-----------

Set the `ARCH` environment variable to the desired target architecture. If it
is not set, the packages will be built for the host architecture.

Bootstrap requirements
----------------------

- POSIX shell.
- Basic POSIX utilities.
- [GNU M4](https://www.gnu.org/software/m4/). By default, packages use the `m4`
  command; the `M4` environment variable may be set to the desired program.
- [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/). By default, packages use the
  `gmake` command; the `GMAKE` environment variable may be set to the desired
  program.
- [Gzip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip) decompressor. By default, packages
  use the `gz` command; the `GZ` environment variable may be set to the desired
  program.
- [Lex](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lex.1p.html). By default,
  packages use the `lex` command; the `LEX` environment variable may be set to
  the desired program.
- Cross C compiler for `ARCH`. By default, when `ARCH` is set, the programs
  used for compilation, such as `as`, `ar` and `ld`, are described by
  `$ARCH-linux-musl-<PROGRAM>`. The corresponding environment variables, such
  as `AS`, `AR` and `LD`, may be set to the desired programs.
